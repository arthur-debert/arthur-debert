With a distinctively playful and smart style, Miração Filmes is a brazilian film production company that specializes in documentary films. The art direction created by [Lucia Dossin](http://www.fiveblackcats.com) was able to create the visual language that is a trademark of their work. Colorful and simple, the website presents their portfolio with multiple view modes. A fun "who we are" section introduces the usual suspects in a very light-hearted tone.
