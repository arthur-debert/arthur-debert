A quick osx droplet: Open In Vim.

Inspired by [Marc Liyanage](http://www.entropy.ch/)'s [OpenTerminalHere](http://www.entropy.ch/software/applescript/) is a simple droplet that will open the selected file(s) in VIM, or open the current directory on the finder window.

Instructions:

- [Download](http://media.stimuli.com.br/projects/open-in-vim.zip) the droplet.
- Unzip and put it some place where it makes sense (i.e. /Applications/Scripts).
- Drag the droplet to you finder toolbar.

And you should be all set. Drag and drop file(s) into it, or select a file and click the droplet.

Thanks for Marc since I've pretty much copied all of his work (applescript is a bit yucky to my taste).
