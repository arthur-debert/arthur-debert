This has been a case of piling features on with every release without any focus on solidity and performance across platforms.

One thing where I do not see Flash vanishing any time soon is with in-browser \"no-need-for-the-user-to-install-anything\" gaming.

Yes, javascript CAN create equivalent experiences, but it's a comparatively much more difficult process that requires a considerably more skilled (and expensive) developer. Flash/Flex's whole development model is geared towards rich experiences: from Actionscript to the Flash and Flex IDEs to the whole CS4 design ecosystem. It certainly has its faults, some quite major, but if you want to deliver a complex, visually rich, desktop style app to the web, there's still no comparison for speed and efficiency of workflow. HTML, for all its progress, is still centered in a page-based model. This could certainly change in the future. There are steps being made in this direction all over the place, but flash has an enormous head start and Adobe shows no signs of slowing down their intense efforts to secure this niche. And I do think the web needs and wants these types of experiences, so for the foreseeable future, the web needs flash. \r\n\r\nA second point: many commentators in this debate seem to view the contenders as if they are static instead of constantly evolving, but if we're talking about the future of the web, we shouldn't be focusing as much on these technologies' current statuses as on their trajectories. In the beginning of the web, html dominated completely and had no competitors. Then flash and other plugins emerged to fill the gaps in what was achievable. Flash outcompeted the other plugins and took over the niche by continually adding features that were either impossible or extremely difficult to replicate using solely html and js. Many of these features are well summarized in the op. So my question is: why will this trend change? What will stop Adobe from taking two  or three steps in the rich experience space for every one that html/js takes, as they have in the past? As hardware and connection speeds improve, which will be better situated to take advantage, and to give developers and designers the tools they need to take advantage? Which will be able to more effectively add features that no one's even thought of yet? I think that if a threat is coming from anywhere, it's coming from the likes of Unity3D, but even here I don't see Unity with a clear overall edge. Their technology is currently head and shoulders above flash for 3D, no question, but flash has the plugin penetration, and Adobe has the resources to make a major step into the 3D space if they ever get around to it.

Considering the large share of users that still have IE6 or IE7 it's obvious that it will take many years before HTML5 can compete with Flash in that area. Of course one can speculate about how HTML5 will dominate in maybe 7-10 years time. But considering that is how long it will take before it becomes a realistic alternative for Flash for serious projects, as opposed to the kind of experiments it's currently used for, I don't feel any rush to declare Flash dead and switch my focus to HTML5 just yet.\r\nBy that time a lot of things might change, and Flash will keep developing.\r\n\r\n2) JavaScript. Let's face it, compared to Actionscript it's retarded. Sure it might be sufficient for the needs of the majority of websites, but as a developer focusing on RIA development doing complex and demanding projects it's just not a replacement. No sane developer would prefer it compared to Actionscript or C#.\r\n\r\nAlso, fact is that all projects I have been working the last few years has used functionality which is not even part of the HTML5 specification. For example audio processing and p2p functionality.\r\nSure, one can call it niche applications, but as a developer I'm not concerned with that. The kind of applications Flash is suited for is the kind of applications I enjoy working with, and it keeps me busy. In a way I actually like the fact that web standards has taken over a lot of the stuff that used to be done in Flash since it means that the expectations of a Flash/Flex developer has become more inline with what I like to focus on.\r\n\r\nQuestion is if HTML5 will further that development or not. I have my doubts, since it's been a long struggle from when DHTML started getting praise as the standards based Flash alternative to when finally JQuery made it possible for developers to do a lot of the basic stuff previously done with Flash without a lot of hassle due to browser fragmentation. We are already seeing fragmentation issues with HTML5, and even sites telling users what browser they need to use, just like back in the 90's. \r\n\r\nI'll be happy to switch my focus to another technology when called for, but I'm not going to switch to something which means going back more than a decade when it comes to language and features, where I have to deal with browser fragmentation and where I have worse performance and lousy accessibility.", "author": "Leo", "post_url": "/trane/2010/feb/01/the-web-doe-not-need-flash/", "post_id": 32, "date": "2010-09-19 09:58:00", "email": "leo@blixtsystems.com"}, {"body": "\"To add insult to injury, most designers on the Flash space have little or no knowledge of HTML or the web.\"\r\n\r\nI'd love to know where you get this info.

Custom video players is one of the many things that Flash can do.\r\n\r\nAs it stands now, it is the video tag is not easier to implement than Flash. It basically requires 2-3 different video formats/codes and if you want to support IEs 50% market share, you still need a Flash player. These old versions of IE are likely to linger just like IE6, which just turned 9 years old.\r\n\r\nI think few can argue with the fact that Flash is the leading RIA technology right now. That being said, it is much easier to follow than it is to lead.\r\n\r\nPeople often forget that Flash is an advancing technology, competiting technologies may very well be where Flash is now, but when the occurs Flash will be better than it is now.\r\n\r\nThe Flash experience is better than it is on the Mac, possibly due to how closed off the Mac is, many programs don't even work on the Mac so it is not a surprise.\r\n\r\nI would like to reinforce the idea that mobile phones will be more powerful, and therefore more capable of running Flash. My phone already does this.\r\n\r\nThe comments that steve jobs made are opinion not fact. He has made a number of mistakes before. I don't find the company to be that innovative either. The ipod touch, iphone, ipad, ipad mini, etc are all really the same technology. Technology that has been around for quite some time, I had a Compaq iPaq 10 years ago, and there have been smart phones.\r\n\r\nClaims that Flash is a cpu hog imply that html5 won't consume just as much. Flash is often used for sophisticated apps that require processing regardless of the language used. Don't plan on seeing any flash like html5 games running at 1% cpu.\r\n\r\nA lot of the bad reputation Flash receives is from wasteful and improper programming. I can't see how html5 will be any different, if anything I expect it to be worse, a lot of html/js I see today is very sloppy.\r\n\r\nLets not also forget that html5 won't be finalized for quite some time, and old IE versions will linger, and prevent wide support for some time. There is also a lack of an IDE that would allow quick development and animation like the Flash IDE.\r\n\r\nOne final thought. Will html5 be be rendered exactly the same in every browser on every operating system on every device?

HTML5 may not be new, to those of us who keep up with the w3c want's and \"do-this'\", plain fact of the matter is that even though HTML5 has been around for a while, its recommendation is new, and it's overall and widespread implementation into browsers IS new - so while we've certainly known about it, there really hasn't been much reason to use it in web design.\r\n\r\nFlash is great for generating an experience, but I've seen way more shit Flash than I've seen shit JS. \r\n\r\nI don't see how you can say that Flash is easier than using the video tag?  Why would you want to use a video in the video tag when the browser or users system doesn't have the support for it...most of the heavy browser market shareholders use Theora and Vorbis(.ogg) with the exception of (maybe?)IE8 and prior which don't even support HTML5 at all.  Regardless of that issue, any type of development working with advancing technology (which might I add includes HTML5) demands graceful fallbacks.  IE6...Why even design for it?  Then your allowing people using the defunct browser to keep using it, and that goes for any browser that enters legacy, not just IE.\r\n\r\nFlash can deliver a great experience if deployed properly, without a doubt.  HTML5 video is meant to introduce a standard to the web designer community without someone having to learn ActionScript/Flash/Flex/MX/AIR etc..Something very easy, that can be done in a few lines, in an .HTML page. With Flash I need an IDE, I need import my video into the .swf/.flv container, (or hook it through some as/.xml for the a player to read) then i have to embed it into a page with, from my experience, way more attributes and parameters being passed than the video tag.\r\n\r\nOn the topic of high end IDE's why do I need one to write HTML5, I could use Notepad, Vim, Emacs, I mean cmon?  If I'm using JavaScript, there are plenty of IDE's out there (Aptana, Dreamweaver).  Anything in Flash that your doing complex, is going to be done in ActionScript anyways - which can also be done in Java or JavaScript  - if it's a language your familiar with, and the language supports the ability - it can be done.\r\n\r\nAlso you have to recognize that Search Engines don't index RIA's very well, even though Flash is partially index-able - it still poses problems for optimization, which as a designer, I'd rather avoid SEO hardship as much as possible.\r\n\r\nMy Flash plugin containers always crash, I've seen Flash cookies set with no mention of them in privacy statements, I've read about huge security vulnerabilities in Flash, how that technology is one of the most prevalent methods of arbritrary code execution  - Security experts and many people involved in developing the web loathe Flash in many different ways.\r\n\r\nI don't hate Flash, Macromedia and Adobe have led the way for great things and defined how the web can and should be experienced.  But I don't see Flash leading the way on the Web anymore.  As a web designer myself, I don't even consider using Flash in websites, I used to back in the day, but as I progressed as a professional I have found easier methods for creating great experiences across the grid.", "author": "Dustin", "post_url": "/trane/2010/feb/01/the-web-doe-not-need-flash/", "post_id": 32, "date": "2010-10-19 22:13:08", "email": "circuitbomb.db@gmail.com"}, {"body": "@Dustin\r\n\r\nI wasn't saying that HTML5 can't make video players just saying that video is not the biggest selling point for Flash, it is just one part of it. I mention this because that seems to be the big selling point and often cited as the reason why it will kill Flash.\r\n\r\nI have developed production players in both Flash and HTML5, and production is the keyword there. That being said, as it stands right now, if you want more than 50% of your visitors to be able to view your video you need to have a Flash fall back if you use a video tag. This will no doubt change in the future, IE6 is just starting to be dropped, but I expect IE8 will linger for a number of years. Therefore using Flash is easier than using Flash and the video tag. Even without Flash you still need 2-3 different video formats/codecs for cross browser compatibility.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, you don't need an IDE to make websites. A lot of my flash projects contain just a blank stage with exported library items. However an IDE allows graphic designers and developers to work out of the same interface, which makes things cleaner, easier, quicker, etc.\r\n\r\nSEO is still weak with Flash, but that has improved, and will continue.\r\n\r\nMy flash plugin never crashes, what is your configuration? You could try chrome which natively supports Flash, no plug in.\r\n\r\nFlash is not the only program with security issues, browsers have them, and Mac OSX certainly has them, they release patches frequently. JS has had some problems. It is an assumption that Flash is any worse than alternatives.\r\n\r\nMy primary point is that Flash is not going anywhere for quite some time.

I initially picked Vim, due to the need for being able to use an editor on my new Red Hat Linux 6.0 (or something) system. The third edition of Running Linux was the tutor, and it was enough to get me up to the \"I just want an editor \" phase you mention. \r\n\r\nSince then, I've had an on and off relation with Vim, since it is so demanding, to need to invest so much learning into an editor, to become really proficient.\r\n\r\nToday, I use nothing else anywhere. I've tried Emacs, but it's inability to do smooth scrolling on Windows is a complete killer for me. Vim has never ever dissapointed me. \r\n\r\nThe only drawback is that Vim is such an abyss of settings, that it still is very daunting, and tiresome to have to constantly \"fix\" to how you think it should work, when sometimes the reason you're off creating new mappings to do wonderful things, is that you're just not yourself aware of the correct key bind in Vim that does JUST what you want. Try hitting ctrl-6. God, I've searched for that key bind for like 5 years.", "author": "Svend Tofte", "post_url": "/trane/2009/sep/19/how-i-learn-stop-worrying-and-love-vim/", "post_id": 29, "date": "2011-02-07 16:54:03", "email": "svend@svendtofte.com"}, {"body": "I just had hard time debuging this one, it seems that in munin 1.4.5 config must be returned as fast as possible.\r\n\r\nWaiting for computed value (such as checking about a second for a http response) turned out to be a reason for not showing plugin for 'list' command in telnet. \r\n\r\nStupid one-line-hint: comment last line in get_config function : )", "author": "MarcMarc", "post_url": "/trane/2009/aug/02/munin-plugin-track-http-response-times/", "post_id": 27, "date": "2011-02-23 17:40:02", "email": "marek@aktywni.pl"}, {"body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nThis is great, however I'm struggling to \"refresh\" a swf loaded with bulkloader.
