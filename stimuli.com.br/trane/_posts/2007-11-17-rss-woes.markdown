A quick apology.

Earlier today, I've updated this site's RSS feeds code. In some readers, this will result in a flood of "new" entries which are not new at all, they'll look like duplicates. I am sorry about that (for all of you 3 feed subscribers), but I had to fix some RSS issues.

For the technically inclined this is what happened:

- Some time ago, I updated the site's code to deal with unicode, after the [unicode merge](http://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/5609).
- I did not update [Django](http:/www.djangoproject.com/) to post unicode merge, so all entries came out with generic titles such as "Entry object" instead of an entry's actual title.
- When I noticed this, I found out that I'd have to update to third party code as well, such as the excellent [django-taggging](http://code.google.com/p/django-tagging/).
- I've way busy doing [this](http://www.stimuli.com.br/works/maxhaus/), until this week when we launched, and I finally had enough time to update Django + my own codebase.
- Since nothing in life is always that simple, I also had to port for the [autoscaping](http://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/6671) changeset.

Thanks for **the** feed subscriber, [Gabriel Late](http://www.gabriellaet.com/) for noticing (and reporting) this.

Now back to some self punishment for reinventing the wheel and doing my own CMS software instead of reaching for a [perfectly fine one](http://wordpress.com/).
