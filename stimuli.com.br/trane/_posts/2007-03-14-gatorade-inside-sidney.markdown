Made for Tribal DDb Canada, this is the front piece for Gatorade's Canadian website. Gathering elements from the tv spot, the website is divided into 6 rooms: six small games that guide us through hockey virtuoso Sidney's life. 

The site has an incredible production: stunning  3D elements, great soundtrack and art direction.

I was responsible for the general structure: main loading, section transitions, and one of the rooms. Working closely with the 3 other flash developers. it was my second stab at implementing a mini api to integrate other developer's modules into a website. Much trickier than it seems, specially if you're keeping a high level of finish, it was a great learning experience.
