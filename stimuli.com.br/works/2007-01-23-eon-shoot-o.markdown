German energy supplier Free-On is the official sponsor of the FWA Cup (UK's soccer league ). Gringo created an online game that mimics their tv campaign: people have to shoot inside the "o" of eon's logo. I was resposnible for the site, but for the game itself.

The website is also to the front end to the game user management application. Users can register, login, play and view their rankings. The website was a hit, having almost 1000 registered players in only one week after going live.

Created for [Unit9](http://unit9.co.uk/) the website makes good use of live action composed into the interface with alpha channel videos.

Go ahead, shoot the o and play to win FA Cup tickets!
