Duplex Bistrot is a charming restaurant in Mello Alves, in my home town,: big bad SÃ£o Paulo. The idea was to create a simple but useful website for a restaurant: a menu that could be neatly displayed and updated, a photo gallery and simple contact information.

The whole site is done with [django](http://www.djangoproject,.com/), and at it's heart is a "menu" application that allows restaurant owners to build an online menu very quickly.

We chose to go with a classic but slightly cocky look, almost all black and white. With litlle text to read it was a good opportunity to use white text on a black background. A simple but effective ajax on the photo gallery gives a bit of eye candy and more stream-lined navigation.
